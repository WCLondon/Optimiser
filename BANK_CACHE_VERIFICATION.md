# Bank LPA/NCA Caching - Manual Verification Guide

## What Changed

The app now caches enriched bank data (with LPA/NCA) in session state to avoid re-resolving on every rerun. This significantly improves performance by eliminating unnecessary API calls to ArcGIS.

## How to Verify the Fix

### 1. First Load (Cache Miss)
- Start the app: `streamlit run app.py`
- On first load, you should see:
  - Sidebar shows "⚠️ Banks not yet cached"
  - Progress indicator: "Resolving bank LPA/NCA… (X%)"
  - After resolution: "Updated N bank(s) with LPA/NCA"
  - Sidebar updates to show: "✅ Banks cached (0m ago)"

### 2. Normal UI Interactions (Cache Hit)
- Try interacting with any UI element:
  - Enter a postcode
  - Change demand rows
  - Select habitat dropdowns
  - Click buttons (except "Refresh Banks LPA/NCA")
- **Expected behavior**: No "Resolving bank LPA/NCA…" message appears
- The cache status in sidebar shows increasing age (e.g., "1m ago", "2m ago")

### 3. Manual Refresh
- Click the "🔄 Refresh Banks LPA/NCA" button in the sidebar
- **Expected behavior**:
  - Progress indicator: "Resolving bank LPA/NCA… (X%)"
  - "Updated N bank(s) with LPA/NCA" message
  - "✅ Banks refreshed!" success message
  - Cache timestamp resets to "0m ago"

### 4. Performance Comparison

#### Before the fix:
- Every UI interaction triggered bank LPA/NCA resolution
- Example: Changing a dropdown = 5-10 second delay (for 10+ banks)
- Multiple API calls per minute during normal use

#### After the fix:
- Bank LPA/NCA resolution only happens:
  1. On first load (unavoidable)
  2. When explicitly clicking "Refresh Banks" button
- UI interactions are instant (no API delay)
- Significant reduction in API calls to ArcGIS

## Technical Details

### Cache Mechanism
- **Storage**: Session state variables
  - `enriched_banks_cache`: DataFrame with enriched bank data
  - `enriched_banks_timestamp`: When the cache was last updated
  - `bank_geo_cache`: Individual lat/lon to LPA/NCA mappings

- **Cache Invalidation**:
  - Automatic: When bank_ids change (new banks added/removed)
  - Manual: Click "Refresh Banks LPA/NCA" button
  - Session: Cache persists for the entire user session

### Function Signature
```python
def enrich_banks_geography(banks_df: pd.DataFrame, force_refresh: bool = False) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Enrich banks DataFrame with LPA/NCA data.
    Uses session state cache to avoid repeated API calls on every rerun.
    
    Args:
        banks_df: DataFrame with banks data
        force_refresh: If True, forces re-resolution of all banks' LPA/NCA even if cached
        
    Returns:
        DataFrame with enriched banks data including lpa_name and nca_name
    """
```

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Cache miss due to bank changes**: If bank_ids in the database change, cache is invalidated automatically
2. **Force refresh**: User can manually trigger re-resolution via button
3. **Empty cache on first load**: Gracefully handles initial state

## Acceptance Criteria Met

- ✅ App no longer resolves banks' LPA/NCA on every rerun
- ✅ Expensive lookups only performed when needed
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Manual refresh button clearly presented in sidebar
- ✅ App is substantially quicker during normal interactions

## Files Modified

- `app.py`:
  - Added `enriched_banks_cache` and `enriched_banks_timestamp` to session state
  - Modified `enrich_banks_geography()` to use cache
  - Added "Refresh Banks LPA/NCA" button in sidebar
  - Added cache status display

## Testing

Run automated tests:
```bash
python test_bank_cache.py
python test_repo_validation.py
```

Both should pass with all green checks.
