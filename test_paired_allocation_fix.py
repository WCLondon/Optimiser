"""
Test to validate the paired allocation fix for substitute trades.

This test verifies that when a substitute habitat is used at adjacent/far tiers,
the paired allocation logic correctly creates paired options with companion habitats.

The fix ensures that:
1. The supply habitat (not demand habitat) price is used when creating paired options
2. Companion candidates exclude the supply habitat itself to avoid self-pairing
