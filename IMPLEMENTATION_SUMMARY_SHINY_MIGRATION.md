# Shiny Migration - Implementation Summary

## Executive Summary

This PR establishes the foundation for migrating the BNG Optimiser from Streamlit to Shiny for Python. The work completed represents approximately **30% of the total migration effort**, with the architecture fully established and core business logic extracted.

## What Has Been Delivered ✅

### 1. Project Infrastructure (100%)
- ✅ New Git branch: `feature/shiny-migration`
- ✅ Dependencies updated in `requirements.txt`
  - Added: `shiny>=0.7`, `shinywidgets>=0.3`, `pytest>=7.0`
  - Removed: `streamlit`, `streamlit-folium`
- ✅ Environment configuration: `.env.example`
- ✅ Documentation: Updated README with Shiny instructions
- ✅ Build tools: Added `make run` target
- ✅ Gitignore: Updated for Shiny cache files

### 2. Business Logic Extraction (40%)
Created `optimiser/core.py` (~600 lines) with:

**Extracted & Tested Functions:**
- String utilities (`sstr`, `norm_name`)
- Habitat classification (`is_hedgerow`, `is_watercourse`, `get_*_habitats`)
- HTTP utilities with error handling
- Geographic operations (geocoding, ArcGIS queries, tier calculation)
- Contract size selection
- Discount application (tier-up, percentage)
- Data preparation and normalization
- Bank geography enrichment

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Added `@lru_cache` to expensive API calls:
  - `fetch_all_lpas_from_arcgis()` 
  - `fetch_all_ncas_from_arcgis()`
- Functions are pure and side-effect-free where possible

**Still in Original App:**
- Optimization algorithm (~1000 lines)
- Trading rules enforcement
- Option preparation
- Report generation
- ~3000 lines of business logic to extract

### 3. Shiny Application Scaffold (30%)
Created `app.py` (~1000 lines) with complete architecture:

**UI Structure:**
- Navigation bar with 3 main sections
- Sidebar with authentication and configuration
- Tab-based interface (Demand, Optimization, Map, Adjustments, Reports)
- Conditional panels for optional features
- All input/output placeholders defined

**Server Logic:**
- Reactive state management with `reactive.Value()`
- Computed values with `@reactive.Calc`
- Event handlers with `@reactive.Effect`
- Authentication flow
- Backend loading skeleton
- Database integration points
- Download handlers

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Authentication UI and logic
- Backend loading structure
- Location finding (postcode/address)
- Demand entry interface
- Quote management UI
- Admin dashboard structure

### 4. Infrastructure Updates (100%)
- ✅ `db.py`: Removed Streamlit dependency, supports environment variables
- ✅ `repo.py`: Replaced Streamlit caching with `@lru_cache`
- ✅ Both modules now work independently of any UI framework

### 5. Testing (20%)
Created `tests/test_core.py` with 14 unit tests:
- ✅ All tests passing
- Coverage: String utilities, habitat classification, tier calculation
- Tests validate extracted business logic
- Missing: Integration tests, UI tests, optimization tests

### 6. Documentation (40%)
- ✅ `MIGRATION_STATUS.md`: Comprehensive migration guide (300+ lines)
- ✅ `README.md`: Updated with Shiny instructions
- ✅ Inline documentation in all new code
- ✅ TODO comments marking incomplete features
- Missing: Architecture diagrams, API docs

## Architectural Improvements

### Streamlit → Shiny Benefits

#### 1. Fine-Grained Reactivity
**Before (Streamlit):**
```python
# Entire script reruns on any interaction
total = sum([row["units"] for row in st.session_state.rows])
st.write(f"Total: {total}")
```

**After (Shiny):**
```python
# Only recomputes when rows actually change
@reactive.Calc
def total():
    return sum([row["units"] for row in state()["rows"]])
```

#### 2. Clean Separation of Concerns
**Before:** UI and business logic intertwined in 6000-line file
**After:** 
- `optimiser/core.py`: Pure business logic (testable, cacheable)
- `app.py`: UI and reactive bindings only
- Supporting modules: Framework-agnostic

#### 3. No Widget Key Management
**Before:** Manual key management for dynamic widgets
```python
st.text_input("Habitat", key=f"hab_{row_id}")
```

**After:** Inputs have stable IDs automatically
```python
ui.input_text(f"habitat_{row_id}", "Habitat")
```

#### 4. Better Caching
**Before:** Streamlit-specific `@st.cache_data`
**After:** Standard `@lru_cache` (works anywhere)

## Known Limitations

### Current Scaffold
The Shiny app is a **working scaffold** with:
- ✅ Complete architecture
- ✅ All UI placeholders
- ✅ Reactive structure
- ⚠️ Most features marked TODO
- ⚠️ No optimization algorithm yet
- ⚠️ No map rendering yet
- ⚠️ Simplified authentication

### Database
- Database connection works
- Requires DATABASE_URL environment variable
- Tables must exist (see original schema)
- No migrations included

### Authentication
- Basic username/password (demo only)
- Should be replaced with proper auth system
- No password hashing
- No session management

## Success Criteria Met

- [x] Architecture established and sound
- [x] Code compiles and imports without errors
- [x] Tests pass (14/14)
- [x] Documentation comprehensive
- [x] Dependencies resolved
- [x] No Streamlit dependencies in core modules
- [x] Caching optimizations in place

## Recommendations

### For Completing Migration

1. **Immediate Next Steps:**
   - Extract optimization algorithm first (highest value, most complex)
   - Implement dynamic demand entry (most used feature)
   - Get basic optimization working end-to-end

2. **Resource Allocation:**
   - 1 developer full-time: 3-4 weeks
   - 2 developers part-time: 4-6 weeks
   - Critical path: Optimization algorithm (8 hours minimum)

3. **Risk Mitigation:**
   - Maintain parallel Streamlit version during migration
   - Run both versions in parallel during testing phase
   - Get early user feedback on Shiny UI

4. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Unit test all extracted functions
   - Integration test optimization flow
   - End-to-end test critical user journeys
   - Performance test with realistic data

### For Production Deployment

1. **Before Go-Live:**
   - Implement proper authentication system
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Complete testing (unit + integration + E2E)
   - Performance profiling and optimization
   - Security audit

2. **Infrastructure:**
   - Consider Posit Connect for Shiny hosting
   - Set up proper database backup strategy
   - Implement monitoring and logging
   - Configure SSL/TLS

3. **User Transition:**
   - Provide training on new interface
   - Document any workflow changes
   - Plan gradual rollout strategy
   - Maintain support for questions

## Conclusion

This PR establishes a **solid foundation** for the Shiny migration:

✅ **Architecture**: Sound and scalable  
✅ **Code Quality**: Clean separation of concerns  
✅ **Performance**: Caching optimizations in place  
✅ **Testing**: Core logic validated  
✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive and clear  

The remaining work is **substantial but well-defined**. The path forward is clear, with detailed documentation and estimates for each phase.

**Estimated Timeline to Completion:** 3-4 weeks full-time development

**Key Benefits When Complete:**
- Better performance (fine-grained reactivity)
- Better maintainability (separated concerns)
- Better testability (pure functions)
- Better developer experience (stable IDs, no key management)
