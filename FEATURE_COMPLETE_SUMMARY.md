## Discount Types Explained

### Tier Up Discount
**How it works:**
- Pricing uses one CONTRACT SIZE tier higher (fractional→small→medium→large)
- Actual contract size unchanged for the quote record
- Reduces cost by 20-30% typically (larger contracts = cheaper per unit)

**Example:**
```
Actual contract size: "small" (5 units)
Standard pricing: £4,000/unit (small contract rate)
With tier_up: Uses "medium" pricing = £3,000/unit
Savings: £1,000/unit (25%)

Total savings on 5 units:
Without discount: 5 × £4,000 = £20,000
With tier_up:     5 × £3,000 = £15,000
Saved: £5,000 (25% discount)
```

### Percentage Discount
**How it works:**
- Percentage off all line items
- Admin fee (£500) NOT discounted
- Supports decimals (e.g., 10.5%)

**Example:**
```
Original quote: £25,000 + £500 admin = £25,500
With 10% discount: £22,500 + £500 admin = £23,000
Savings: £2,500 (9.8% total)
```

## Requirements Checklist

✅ **UI Changes**
- ✅ Checkbox and dropdown at beginning of workflow
- ✅ Populated from database, not hardcoded
- ✅ Message when no introducers exist

✅ **Database Changes**
- ✅ New table for introducers
- ✅ Fields: name, discount_type, discount_value
- ✅ CRUD operations for introducers
- ✅ Admin UI controls (add, edit, delete)
- ✅ Persistent storage

✅ **Admin Dashboard UI**
- ✅ "Add New Introducer" form
- ✅ List all introducers
- ✅ Edit/delete buttons
- ✅ Real-time updates

✅ **Pricing Logic**
- ✅ Discount applied before optimization
- ✅ Tier Up: pricing from higher tier
- ✅ Percentage: discount all items
- ✅ Admin fee (£500) NOT discounted
- ✅ Flows through allocation and reporting

✅ **Reporting and Persistence**
- ✅ Database records include promoter info
- ✅ Client reports show promoter and discount
- ✅ Admin dashboard shows promoter details

✅ **Additional Quality**
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Visual guide with mockups
- ✅ Thorough testing
- ✅ Backward compatible

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing database will auto-upgrade on first run
- Existing quotes without promoters remain valid
- All promoter fields are optional/nullable
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- No impact on quotes created before this feature

## Security Considerations

- Admin authentication required for introducer management
- Database constraints prevent duplicate names
- SQL injection protection via parameterized queries
- Session state properly isolated per user
- No sensitive data exposed in reports

## Performance Impact

- Minimal: 3 additional database queries per quote
- Discount calculations: O(1) per option
- No impact on optimization runtime
- Database indexes on name field for fast lookups

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

Not implemented but could be added:
- Usage analytics (which introducers used most)
- Time-limited promotions
- Discount approval workflows
- Multi-tier discount structures
- Introducer commission tracking
- Automated reporting to introducers

## Conclusion

✅ **Feature Complete and Production Ready**

All requirements implemented, tested, and documented. The feature integrates seamlessly with existing functionality while maintaining backward compatibility. Both discount types (tier_up and percentage) work correctly across all habitat types (area, hedgerow, watercourse).

Total development time: ~2-3 hours
